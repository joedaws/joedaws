### Hi there 👋

See also [atelier-machines](https://ateliermachines.com) for writing about specific things that have helped me think about building
a good life.

- Recently I have worked on backend systems which follow a general theme of
  extracting structured data from unstructured text. If you have an interest in related problems I hope
  we'll exchange some knowledge.
- I enjoy building tiny CLIs to help me use computers
  - [tape](https://github.com/joedaws/tape) a TUI application for freewriting
  - [social-print](https://github.com/joedaws/social-print) I like to write in text and md, but it's frustrating to copy and paste from those files into
    social sites. This tool helps with that.
  - [solitaire](https://github.com/joedaws/solitaire) I like Solitaire so I built a CLI version.
- Simulation
  - Built a simulation of social and political interaction [lofi-eldritch-cosmos](https://github.com/joedaws/lofi-eldritch-cosmos)
